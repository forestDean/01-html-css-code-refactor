## Description
	
The webpage has been refactored for the client - **Horiseon**.

HTML and CSS code has been optimised for search engines (SEO) by applying a semantic structure and accessibility standards. HTML elements now follow a logical order, with `alt` attributes assigned to images and icons. Page errors have been corrected and aesthetic modifications applied. The CSS has been consolidated, annotated and redundant elements removed.
